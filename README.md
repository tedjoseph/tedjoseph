- 👋 Hi, I’m @tedjoseph
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering, data analytics, web development, graphic design and video editing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning. Many tasks that developers are responsible are often redundant and that is where automation is truly exciting. IDEs like Visual Basic Code or modern programming frameworks help assist push the envelope further in quicker debugging and deployment rates.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything exciting!
